\chapter{Characterization of Fermionic Gaussian States}
In order to provide the necessary background to understand the choice of our system, in this chapter we present an overview of Fermionic  states, its connection to Majorana fermions, how Gaussian states are related with Fermionic systems (the Covariance Matrix formalism, its connection to specific quadratic Hamiltonians, as well as an introduction to a Grassmann approach, to understand the computation of observables for Fermionic systems and its importance in Fermionic linear optics (FLO). At the end, we illustrate this by showing a particular example of the use of Grassmann variables.\\
\section{Overview}
In many areas of physics one has to has to deal with solving quantum many body problems, which is often a computationally difficult if not impossible task. It is also well known that under appropriate approximations a wide class of complicated Hamiltonians with many-body interactions can be often be mapped onto Hamiltonians that are quadratic in annihilation and creation operators and have the generic form \cite{botero_bcs-like_2004}

\begin{equation}
\hat{H}=\sum_{i j} C_{i j} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger} \hat{a}_{j}+\sum_{i j}\left(A_{i j} \hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{j}^{\dagger}+\mathrm{h.c.}\right)
\label{CH2:QuadraticHamiltonian}
\end{equation}

where $i,j$ run from $1$ to the number of modes in the system ($N$) and $\hat{a}_i$, $\hat{a}^{\dagger}_i$ are Fermionic annihilation and creation operators which satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations (CAR)\cite{fradkin_field_1997}

\begin{equation}
\left\{\hat{a}_{k}, \hat{a}_{l}\right\}=\left\{\hat{a}_{k}^{\dagger}, \hat{a}_{l}^{\dagger}\right\}=0, \quad\left\{\hat{a}_{k}, \hat{a}_{l}^{\dagger}\right\}=\delta_{k l}.
\label{CH2:Anticommutation}
\end{equation}

A convenience when working with these kind of Hamiltonians is that can diagonalized via a Bogoliubov- Valantin transformations transformation (i.e., canonical transformations), which maps Fermionic creation and annihilation operators on the creation and annihilation operators of non-interacting quasi-particles\cite{berezin_method_1966,bogoljubov_new_1958}. Explicitly the transformation looks like

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
\hat{a}_{i} \mapsto \gamma_{i} \hat{q}_{i}+\kappa_{i} \hat{q}_{i}^{\dagger}, \\
\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger} \mapsto \bar{\gamma}_{i} \hat{q}_{i}^{\dagger}+\bar{\kappa}_{i} \hat{q}_{i}.
\end{array}
\label{CH2:Bogoliuvov}
\end{equation}

where $\gamma_i , \kappa_i$ are complex numbers such that preserves the canonical anti-commutation relations given by \eqref{CH2:Anticommutation} for $\hat{q}$, $\hat{q}^{\dagger}$\footnote{This relation can also be expresses as a condition over $\gamma_i , \kappa_i$,
\[ \gamma_i ^2+ \kappa_i^2 = 1,\]
and 
\[\left\{\hat{q}_{k}, \hat{q}_{l}\right\}=\left\{\hat{q}_{k}^{\dagger}, \hat{q}_{l}^{\dagger}\right\}=0, \quad\left\{\hat{q}_{k}, \hat{q}_{l}^{\dagger}\right\}=\delta_{k l}.\]
 }.
\\
Many relevant physics models are diagonalizable via a Bogoliubov-Valantin transformations, some examples are the Hubbard model, BCS theory of superconductivity in the mean field or Hartree-Fock approximation, and certain solvable spin-chain models (After a Jordan-Wigner transformation) \cite{fradkin_field_1997}. As we will later explain, an important feature about the class of Hamiltonians described by \eqref{CH2:QuadraticHamiltonian}, if not the most important for the purpose of this project,  is that not only the ground state (quasi-particle vacuum)  but all eigenstates describing a excitation  in a set of quasi-particles, belong to the class of so-called Fermionic Gaussian states\cite{botero_bcs-like_2004}. What is important about these class of states is that are fully characterized by second order correlations, because all the higher moments factorize. This is known as Wick's theorem\cite{bravyi_classical_2005, molinari_notes_2017}, being this the motivation to formulate an equivalent and convenient characterization of second order correlations, which is defined in terms of Majorana fermions and is known as Fermionic covariance matrix.
\section{Majorana Fermions}
Majorara fermions are fermions such that they are their own antiparticle. In the frame of condensed matter Majorana Fermions (quasi-particles) can be interpreted as a superposition of a electron state and a hole \cite{leijnse_introduction_2012}.
\\
The formalism of Majorana fermions or Majorana modes of the system (with $N$ modes) can be introduce with the operators
\begin{equation}
\hat{c}_{2j-1}=\hat{a}_{j}^{\dagger}+\hat{a}_{j}, \quad \hat{c}_{2j}=(-i)\left(a_{j}^{\dagger}-a_{j}\right).
\label{CH2:majorana}
\end{equation}
In which case its canonical anti-commutation relations (CAR) take the form
\begin{equation}
\left\{\hat{c}_{k},\hat{c}_{l}\right\}=2 \delta_{k l}.
\label{CH2:CAR_majorana}
\end{equation}

The anti-commutation relations is seen to be a consequence of an $\mathbb{R}^{2N}$ Clifford algebra\footnote{By inspection of \eqref{CH2:CAR_majorana} we see that  any linear transformation of the form $\tilde{\gamma}_{\alpha} = O_{\alpha\beta}\gamma_{\beta}$ where $O\in SO(2N)$, the special orthogonal group in $2N$  dimensions}. Transformation in between Fermionic and Majorana operators is achieved by matrix of the block form
\begin{equation}
\Omega=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbb{I} & \mathbb{I} \\
i \mathbb{I} & -i \mathbb{I}
\end{array}\right),
\end{equation}

and then the map from Fermionic ($\vec{\hat{a}}^{T} = (\hat{a}_1,\ldots,\hat{a}_1^{\dagger},\ldots)$) and Majorana ($\vec{\hat{c}}^{T} = (\hat{c}_1,\ldots,\hat{c}_1^{\dagger},\ldots)$) operators is written as $\Omega\vec{\hat{a}}=\vec{\hat{c}}$.
\\
By changing from Fermionic operators to Majorana operators is possible, and convenient, to define de Fermionic covariance matrix which fully characterise Gaussians states\footnote{In comparison to its boson counterpart the fermion Gaussian states have the property that correlation functions for the creation/annihilation operators are completely determined by the two-point functions according to Wickâ€™s theorem \cite{westwanski_general_1973}, and moreover,  since this property is extensible to correlation function pertaining to a reduced subset of the modes, it follows that any partial (reduced) density matrix obtained from $\rho$ remains Gaussian.}.
\section{Fermionic Covariance matrix }
A system of $N$ fermion modes, described by a set of creation and annihilation operators $\hat{a}^{\dagger}, \hat{a}$  and satisfying the  canonical anti-commutations relations in \eqref{CH2:Anticommutation}, is Gaussian if for such system any state $\rho$ can be written as  \cite{cheong_many-body_2003}

\begin{equation}
\rho=\bigotimes_{k=1}^{N} \tilde{\rho}_{k}, \quad \tilde{\rho}_{k}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\lambda_{i}\left[\tilde{a}_{i}^{\dagger}, \tilde{a}_{i}\right]\right),
\label{CH2:rho_gaussiano_no_exp}
\end{equation}

for a certain choice of mode basis $\tilde{a}=u_{i}^{j}\hat{a}_{j} + v_{i}^{j}\hat{a}_{j}^{\dagger}$, and with $|\lambda_i|\leq 1$, where the equality holds for pure states. Equivalently, as mentioned before, Gaussian States are fully characterized by their second moments, so an equivalent form of writing $\rho$ is
\begin{equation}
\rho= \frac{1}{Z}\cdot \exp \left[-\frac{i}{4} \hat{c}^{T} G \hat{c}\right],
\label{CH2:rho_gaussiano_exp}
\end{equation}
with $\hat{c} = (\hat{c}_1,\hat{c}_2,\ldots,\hat{c}_{2N})$, the vector of Majorana operators \eqref{CH2:majorana}, $Z$ a normalization constant and $G$ real anti-symmetric $2N\times 2N$ matrix. 
\\
Since $G$ is a skew-symmetric matrix, it can always be brought to the block diagonal form 
\begin{equation}
O G O^{T}=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{N}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -\beta_{j} \\
\beta_{j} & 0
\end{array}\right) \quad \text { with } \quad O \in \mathrm{SO}(2 \mathrm{N}),
\label{CH2:MatrixG_Williamson}
\end{equation}
by a special orthogonal matrix $O\in SO(2N)$ where the $\beta_{j}$ are called the Williamson eigenvalues of the matrix $G$. 
From equation \eqref{CH2:rho_gaussiano_exp} it is clear that Gaussian states have an interpretation as thermal (Gibbs) states corresponding to a Hamiltonian of the form
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}=\frac{i}{4} \hat{c}^{T}G\hat{c}= \frac{i}{4} \sum_{k>l}G_{kl}\left[\hat{c}_{k},\hat{c}_{l}\right].
\label{CH2:Hamiltonian_majorana}
\end{equation}

and \eqref{CH2:MatrixG_Williamson} shows that every Gaussian state has a normal mode decomposition in terms of $N$ single mode ``thermal states'' of the form \eqref{CH2:rho_gaussiano_no_exp} ($\sim \text{exp}(-\beta \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a})$)\cite{kraus_pairing_2009}. From this is clear, that the state can be fully determined by the expectation values of quadratic operators $(\hat{a}_i^{(\dagger)}\hat{a}_j^{(\dagger)}$ and  $\hat{a}^{\dagger}_i\hat{a}_j)$. So collecting these expectation values in a real and skew-symmetric covariance matrix $\Gamma$ which is defined via
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{k l}=\frac{i}{2} \operatorname{tr}\left(\rho\left[c_{k}, c_{l}\right]\right).
\label{CH2:Cov_matrix_elements}
\end{equation}
Since $\Gamma$ is also a anti-symmetric matrix, it can be brought into a block diagonal form by a canonical transformation
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\Gamma} = O \Gamma O^{T}=\bigoplus_{i=1}^{M}\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & \lambda_{i} \\
-\lambda_{i} & 0
\end{array}\right),
\label{CH2:Williamson_Cov_fermionic_matrix}
\end{equation}
with $\lambda_i\geq 0$ the Williamson eigenvalues.\\
In terms of the creation/annihilation operators obtained from the transformed $\tilde{c}=O\hat{c}$, the Gaussian state $\rho$ takes the form \eqref{CH2:rho_gaussiano_exp} with $\tilde{\Gamma}$ as its Fermionic covariance matrix. It is easy to see that the relation between $G$ and $\Gamma$ is given by $\lambda_{i} = \tanh{\left(\beta_{i}/2\right)}$, for $i=1,2,\ldots,N$\cite{kraus_pairing_2009}. 
\newline
The equivalence between the special orthogonal group in $2N$ dimensions ($SO(2N)$) and the Fermionic Gaussian states, drives to interesting an interesting  property about states describing multi-particles excitations. If $\ket{\textit{vacuum}}$ is the ground state of some Hamiltonian, with annihilation operators $\hat{a}_{i}$ in a given quasi-particle basis, then $\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}\ket{\textit{vacuum}} = \hat{c}_{2i}\ket{\textit{vacuum}}$. Meaning that any multi-particle state of this kind is obtained from some transformation (that preserves the canonical anti-commutation relations) of the ground state $\ket{\textit{vacuum}}$, remains Gaussian. In other words, Gaussian states are preserved under any unitary transformation that preserves anti-commutation relations.
\newline 
The fact that all eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in \eqref{CH2:QuadraticHamiltonian} are Gaussian as well as the fact that this property is extensible to a reduced subset of the modes, is quite important since a big part of this work is focused on the study of the Fermionic covariance matrix of the $XY$ model.
\section{Grassmann Approach}

In Quantum Optics the most common states we work with are the so-called coherent states,  these states are of great importance since  these states turned out to be a proper basis for describing all states of electromagnetic field, are also well known for its intrinsic property that the particle number of such states is indefinite, while the phase is determined exactly\cite{QuantumOptics_wolfgang}, therefore these states can be seen as the counter part of the Fock states\footnote{States that belong to the Fock space have the property that their particle number is well defined but not its phase.}\\
Considering the ambit of this work consider the study of a Fermionic system it is natural to ask whether or not is possible to describe Fermionic field in a resemblant way Bosonic fields are described\footnote{With its operators of annihilation and creation $\hat{a}^{\dagger}$,$\hat{a}$}\cite{noauthor_density_2007}. The study of Fermionic system is know as Fermionic Linear Optics (FLO)\footnote{This term basically refers to a system consisting of non-interacting electrons in a controllable external potential and a detector that measures projectively occupation numbers of single-electron modes.}. FLO shares many features with a limited version of photon linear optics, where mostly Gaussian states appears\cite{knill_scheme_2001}. The main reason for this is that non-interacting fermion, as well as bosons, are described byin the Lagrangian representation  by Gaussian integrals over anti-commutating (commutating) variables\cite{bravyi_lagrangian_2004}. The states achievable with FLO belong to a closure of a low dimensional Lie group\footnote{Growing only quadratically with the number of modes}. The elements of this Lie group are known as  Gaussian operators \cite{knill_fermionic_2001}, which are the states we mentioned in the latter section and we defined as operators that can be represented as an exponential of another operator which is quadratic in the creation/annihilation operators\footnote{Even though this definition is not valid in cases when the operator does not have full rank, the definition we use here fits for the purpose of this work}.\\
It is worth mentioning that the results of this section can be used beyond the scope of this project, the next results are general and make use of methods used in Fermionic Gaussian approximations.
\subsection{Fermionic Linear Optics}
In order to give a more strict definition of what FLO is, we start by defining $N$ abstract Fermionic modes which can be defined by creation $\hat{a}_j$ and annihilation $\hat{a}_j^{\dagger}$, $j=1,\ldots,N$, satisfying \eqref{CH2:Anticommutation}. As mentioned above, any state of the system can be generated from the vacuum state $\ket{\textit{vacuum}}$ of the Fock basis, which we define as
\begin{equation}
\ket{N_1,\ldots,N_{N}} = \left(\hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}\right)^{N_{1}} \cdots\left(\hat{a}_{n}^{\dagger}\right)^{N_{n}}\left|\textit{vacuum}\right\rangle,
\label{CH2:Fock_Space}
\end{equation}
with $N_i\in \{0,1\}$, so any arbitrary state of the system can be written as a superposition of the Fock basis.\\
However, instead of working with the operator of creation/annihilation we instead work with operators described previously in \eqref{CH2:majorana}, which generate the \textit{Clifford} algebra ($\mathcal{C}_{2N}$) described in \eqref{CH2:CAR_majorana}. Thus Hamiltonians of the form \eqref{CH2:QuadraticHamiltonian} can be brought to the form of \eqref{CH2:Hamiltonian_majorana}. Something to stress is the fact that unitary elements of FLO constitute a group of \textit{canonical transformations} $G_{c}\subset U(2^{N})$\footnote{This can be translated as $V\in G_{c}$ if and only if $V= \exp(i\hat{H})$, with $\hat{H}$ from \eqref{CH2:Hamiltonian_majorana}}, making then see the action of a canonical transformation $V\in G_c$ on the operators $\{\hat{c}_a\}$ as a rotation $R\in SO(2N)$.\\
When working with FLO we could naively think the formulation should be as if we work with bosons, however, this is not the case, certainly, we can make an analogue formulation as the one on bosons. The first problem we deal is that unitary elements of FLO do not preserve the total number of particles, and we do not have a preferred vacuum state, and neither we have a preferred normal ordering of Fermionic operators. Secondly we often would like to treat both pure and mixed states on equal footing\cite{francesco_conformal_1997}. To address these problems we are going show a brief outline of the anti-commutating variables formalism.
\subsection{Grassmann Calculus}
Consider $\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_N$ span a N-dimensional complex linear space $\mathbb{C}^{N}$. From the anti-commutation relation we get that for $\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_N$,
\begin{equation}
\theta_{a}^{2}=0 \quad \text { and } \quad \theta_{a} \theta_{b}+\theta_{b} \theta_{a}=0,
\label{CH2:Grassmann_anticommutation}
\end{equation}
 
so the most general function of a Grassmann algebra with complex coefficients $\mathcal{G}_{N}$ is therefore a polynomial of $\theta$'s
\begin{equation}
f(\theta)=\alpha+\sum_{p=1}^{n} \sum_{1 \leq a_{1}<\cdots<a_{p} \leq N} \alpha_{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{p}} \theta_{a_{1}} \cdots \theta_{a_{p}},
\label{CH2:Grassmann_function}
\end{equation}
where the coefficients $\alpha_{*}$ are complex numbers. A polynomial $f(\theta)$ will be called \textit{even} if it involves only even powers of $\theta$. This draw our attention since even elements constitute the center of the Grassmann algebra.\\
It is possible to differentiate functions of Grassmann variables.  A partial derivative over $\theta_{a}$ is a linear operator from $\mathcal{G}_{N}$ to $ \mathcal{G}_{N}$, which is defined by
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}} 1=0, \quad \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}} \theta_{b}=\delta_{a b},
\label{CH2:Grassmann_diferential}
\end{equation}
and Liebniz's rule
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}}\left(\theta_{b} f(\theta)\right)=\delta_{a b} f(\theta)-\theta_{b} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}} f(\theta).
\label{CH2:Grassmann_diferential_liebniz}
\end{equation}
The equality \eqref{CH2:Grassmann_diferential_liebniz} implies that 
\begin{equation}
\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}}, \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{b}}\right\}=0
\label{CH2:Grassmann_partial_derivative_anticommutation}
\end{equation}
Since a derivative $\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta_{a}}f(\theta)$ does not depend upon variable $\theta_{a}$, it is sometimes convenient to think about differentiation as a linear operator mapping $\mathcal{G}_{n}$ into $\mathcal{G}_{n-1}$. Such operator is called integration and is denoted as\cite{bravyi_lagrangian_2004} \footnote{Here we will use a compact notation \[\int \mathrm{D} \theta \equiv \int d \theta_{n} \cdots \int d \theta_{2} \int d \theta_{1},\] and the order is chosen such that \[\int D\theta\ \theta_1\cdots\theta_n = 1\]
}
\begin{equation}
\int d \theta_{a} \equiv \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}}: \mathcal{G}_{n} \rightarrow \mathcal{G}_{n-1}.
\label{CH2:Grassmann_Integration_relation}
\end{equation}

From equation \eqref{CH2:Grassmann_partial_derivative_anticommutation}  we have that
\begin{equation}
\int \mathrm{D} \theta \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_{a}} f(\theta)=0,
\end{equation}
this equation combined with \eqref{CH2:Grassmann_diferential_liebniz} give us the anti-commuting version of integration by parts.
\newline
With these properties we show the main equation that will help us calculate what is need for the purpose of this work.
\newline
\textit{For a vectors of Grassmann variables  $\vec{\theta}$, $\vec{\eta}$ and complex anti-symmetric matrix $M$ we have}

\begin{equation}
\int \mathrm{D} \theta \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \theta^{T} M \theta\right)=i^{n} \operatorname{Pf}(M),
\label{CH2:Grassman_property_1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\int \mathrm{D} \theta \exp \left(\eta^{T} \theta+\frac{i}{2} \theta^{T} M \theta\right)= i^{n} \operatorname{Pf}(M)  \cdot \exp \left(-\frac{i}{2} \eta^{T} M^{-1} \eta\right).
\label{CH2:Grassman_property_2}
\end{equation}
In these formulas $\operatorname{Pf}(N)$ is the Pfaffian of a complex antisymmetric matrix $N$ defined as  anti-symmetrized product $\mathcal{A}(N_{1,2}N_{3,4}\cdots N_{2n-1,2n})$ that is
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Pf}(N)=\frac{1}{2^{n} n !} \sum_{\sigma \in S_{2 n}} \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma) N_{\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}} \cdots N_{\sigma_{2 n-1} \sigma_{2 n}}
\label{CH2:Grassmann_Pfaffian}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Gaussian States}
Here we introduce the Grassmann version of the covariance matrix approach  showed in \cite{bravyi_lagrangian_2004}. It turns out that the connection between these two approaches is the map assigning the Grassmann variable to each Majorana operator.
\newline
Consider $X$ to be a linear operator on the Clifford algebra $\mathcal{C}_{2n}$ that is generated by Majorana operators given in \eqref{CH2:majorana}fulfilling the CAR in \eqref{CH2:CAR_majorana}. One can naturally assign a polynomial in Grassmann variables via

\begin{equation}
\omega\left(\hat{c}_{p} \hat{c}_{q} \cdots \hat{c}_{r}, \theta\right)=\theta_{p} \theta_{q} \cdots \theta_{r}, \quad \omega(\hat{\mathbb{I}}, \theta)=1,
\label{CH2:Gaussian_majorana_map_majorana}
\end{equation}
with $\omega(X,\theta)\in \mathcal{G}_{2n}$ ($2n$ Grassmann variables)\footnote{This definition extends by linearity to an arbitrary $X\in \mathcal{C}_{2n}$. It should be enphasized that $\omega$ is just an isomorphism of linear spaces and it has nothing to do with multiplication in the algebras $\mathcal{C}_{2n}$ and $\mathcal{G}_{2n}$}.
\newline
Then we define a state in terms of Gaussianity of its Grassmann representation. A quantum state of $n$ fermionic modes is Gaussian if and only if its operator  $\rho\in\mathcal{C}_{2n}$ has a Gaussian Grassmann representation given by 
\begin{equation}
\omega(\rho, \theta)=\frac{1}{2^{n}} \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \theta^{T} \Gamma \theta\right),
\label{CH2:Gaussian_Grassmann}
\end{equation}
for some $2n\times 2n$ real antisymetric matrix $\Gamma$. the matrix $\Gamma$ is called a correlation matrix of $\rho$. Since by definition all Gaussian states are described by even polynomial in the Grassmann representation, if $\rho \in \mathcal{C}_{2n}$ is a Gaussian state, its correlation matrix can be found from
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_{a b}=\frac{i}{2} \operatorname{Tr}\left(\rho\left[\hat{c}_{a}, \hat{c}_{b}\right]\right),
\label{CH2:Correlation_matrix_Grassmann}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to the definition in \eqref{CH2:Cov_matrix_elements}.
\newline
To illustrate the results we are going to show as an illustrative example the Grassmann representation of the projector in the first mode.
\subsection{Example: Computing observable in Grassmann representation of the projector}

Consider the projector $\hat{a}_1\hat{a}_1^{\dagger}$ projecting into a state ``the first mode is empty'', so in terms of Majorana operators we can write.
\begin{equation}
\hat{a}_{1} \hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{I}+i \hat{c}_{1} \hat{c}_{2}\right)
\label{CH2:example_Grassman_1}
\end{equation}
 Its Grassmann representation looks as
 \begin{equation}
 \omega\left(\hat{a}_{1} \hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}, \theta\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\hat{\mathbb{I}}+i \theta_{1} \theta_{2}\right)=\frac{1}{2} \exp \left(i \theta_{1} \theta_{2}\right)
 \label{CH2:example_Grassman_2}
 \end{equation}

For any operators $X, Y \in \mathcal{C}_{2 n}$ one can compute a trace using the formula \cite{bravyi_lagrangian_2004}
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Tr}(X Y)=(-2)^{n} \int D \theta D \mu e^{\theta^{T} \mu} \omega(X, \theta) \omega(Y, \mu),
\label{CH2:example_Grassman_3}
\end{equation}
which applied to our case reads
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Tr}\left(\rho \hat{a}_{1} \hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}\right)=(-2)^{n} \int D \theta D \mu e^{\theta^{T} \mu} \omega\left(\hat{a}_{1} \hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}, \theta\right) \omega(\rho, \mu)
\label{CH2:example_Grassman_4}
\end{equation}

Now, it is convenient to introduce a $2n\times 2n$ matrix $K$ with only non-zero matrix elements $K_{12}=1$ and $K_{21}=-1$, such that we can write $\omega\left(\hat{a}_{1} \hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}, \theta\right)=\frac{1}{2} \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \theta^{T} K \theta\right)$, and therefore

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\operatorname{Tr}\left(\rho a_{1} a_{1}^{\dagger}\right) &=\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2} \int D \theta \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \theta^{T} K \theta\right) \int D \mu \exp \left(\theta^{T} \mu+\frac{i}{2} \mu^{T} \Gamma \mu\right)=\\
&=\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2} \operatorname{Pf}(\Gamma) \int D \theta \exp \left(\frac{i}{2} \theta^{T}\left(K-\Gamma^{-1}\right) \theta\right)=\\
&=\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{Pf}(\Gamma) \operatorname{Pf}\left(K-\Gamma^{-1}\right).
\end{aligned}
\label{CH2:example_Grassman_5}
\end{equation}

If $\Gamma$ is a singular matrix the last expression may be regularized taking into account that $\operatorname(Pf)(M)^{2}=det(M)$ for any antisymmetric matrix $M$.  Thus we arrive to
\begin{equation}
\left[\operatorname{Tr}\left(\rho \hat{a}_{1} \hat{a}_{1}^{\dagger}\right)\right]^{2}=\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{det}(\Gamma K-\mathbb{I}),
\label{CH2:example_Grassman_6}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{I}$ is $2n\times 2n$ unit matrix.\\
The latter result can be used also to deduce the trace of a product of two states ($\rho_1 \rho_2$), with respective correlation matrix $\Gamma_1$ $\Gamma_2$
\begin{equation}
\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1\rho_2)=\frac{1}{2^{n}}\operatorname{Pf}(\Gamma_1) \operatorname{Pf}\left(\Gamma_2-\Gamma_1^{-1}\right).
\label{CH2:Product_2_states}
\end{equation}
It is known that any real $2N\times 2N$ antisymmetric matrix $M$ can be transformed by the adjoint action of $SO(2N)$ into a block diagonal form 
of the form
\begin{equation}
O \Gamma_i O^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & D_i \\
-D_i & 0
\end{array}\right],
\label{CH2:Reduction_rotation_matrix}
\end{equation}
where $D_{i}$ is a matrix ($N\times N$) with zero in its entries except for its diagonal. The square of  the equation \eqref{CH2:Product_2_states} can be find easily using the equation \eqref{CH2:example_Grassman_6}

\begin{align}
\operatorname{Tr}(\rho_1\rho_2)^{2}&=\frac{1}{2^{2n}}\operatorname{det}\left\{\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & D_1 \\
-D_1 & 0
\end{array}\right]\cdot\left[\begin{array}{cc}
0 & D_2 \\
-D_2 & 0
\end{array}\right] - \left[\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbb{I}_{N\times N} & 0 \\
0 & \mathbb{I}_{N\times N}
\end{array}\right]
\right\}\nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{2^{2n}}\operatorname{det}\left[\begin{array}{cc}
-D_1D_2- \mathbb{I}_{N\times N}& 0 \\
0 & -D_1D_2-\mathbb{I}_{N\times N}
\end{array}\right] \nonumber\\
&=\frac{1}{2^{2n}}\left(\prod_{i=1}^{N}D_{1_i}D_{2_i}+1\right)^{2},
\label{CH2:Trace_2_cov_matrix}
\end{align}
where $D_{j_i}$, $j=1,2$ are the $i$-th diagonal element of the matrix $j$.\\
The last equation give us then a result we would use later on to compute the trace of the product of two different states for the $XY$ model. As mentioned before the results in this chapter could go beyond the scope of this project, nevertheless, by defining Grassmann variables it is possible to extend the results of this project to other fermion models.\\
In the next chapter we will use all the concepts to the specific case of the XY model chain, and we will provide a full characterization of this model.
