abstract = {Notions of a Gaussian state and a Gaussian linear map are generalized to the case of anticommuting (Grassmann) variables. Conditions under which a Gaussian map is trace preserving and (or) completely positive are formulated. For any Gaussian map an explicit formula relating correlation matrices of input and output states is presented. This formalism allows to develop the Lagrangian representation for fermionic linear optics (FLO). It covers both unitary operations and the single-mode projectors associated with FLO measurements. Using the Lagrangian representation we reduce a classical simulation of FLO to a computation of Gaussian integrals over Grassmann variables. Explicit formulas describing evolution of a quantum state under FLO operations are put forward.},

abstract = "Two genuinely quantum mechanical models for an antiferromagnetic linear chain with nearest neighbor interactions are constructed and solved exactly, in the sense that the ground state, all the elementary excitations and the free energy are found. A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter λ which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system."

abstract = "Computational anatomy is the science of anatomical shape examined by deforming a template organ into a subject organ. It compares and contrasts organ shapes to inspire personalized treatments or find group differences in case-control studies. Independently of the transformation model used, the task of finding deformations between organs is a statistical task concerned with estimating parameters. Recently it has become important to go beyond “best” estimates and quantify the variability of estimates. The variability is caused by noise in the image, model misspecification, or sampling variability in an observational study. Bayesian statistics provides a rigorous framework to build models that can quantify uncertainty. In this book chapter, we will review some of the basics of Bayesian statistics and relate it to our own experience in applying Bayesian ideas in computational anatomy. We will divide the presentation into two parts. First, we formulate image registration using parametric Bayesian statistics and elaborate on some of the practical difficulties that we encountered in our own work. Second, we will give an example of nonparametric Bayesian statistics applied to clustering of deformation fields into parcels of contiguous voxels."

abstract="After two chapters of preparation on the slice and two-stage Gibbs samplers, respectively, we are now ready to envision the entire picture for the Gibbs sampler. We describe the general method in Section 10.1, whose theoretical properties are less complete than for the two-stage special case (see Section 10.2): The defining difference between that sampler and the multi-stage version considered here is that the interleaving structure of the two-stage chain does not carry over. Some of the consequences of interleaving are the fact that the individual subchains are also Markov chains, and the Duality Principle and Rao-Blackwellization hold in some generality. None of that is true here, in the multi-stage case. Nevertheless, the multi-stage Gibbs sampler enjoys many optimality properties, and still might be considered the workhorse of the MCMC world. The remainder of this chapter deals with implementation considerations, many in connection with the important role of the Gibbs sampler in Bayesian Statistics.",

This agrees with the thermodynamic entropy of Clausius when M specifies the locally conserved quantities of a system in local thermal equilibrium (LTE). Here we discuss Boltzmann’s entropy, involving an appropriate choice of macro-variables, for systems not in LTE. We generalize the formulas of Boltzmann for dilute gases and of Resibois for hard sphere fluids and show that for macro-variables satisfying any deterministic autonomous evolution equation arising from the microscopic dynamics the corresponding Boltzmann entropy must satisfy an H-theorem."

    abstract = { The Gibbs entropy of a macroscopic classical system is a function of a probability distribution over phase space, i.e., of an ensemble. In contrast, the Boltzmann entropy is a function on phase space, and is thus defined for an individual system. Our aim is to discuss and compare these two notions of entropy, along with the associated ensemblist and individualist views of thermal equilibrium. Using the Gibbsian ensembles for the computation of the Gibbs entropy, the two notions yield the same (leading order) values for the entropy of a macroscopic system in thermal equilibrium. The two approaches do not, however, necessarily agree for non-equilibrium systems. For those, we argue that the Boltzmann entropy is the one that corresponds to thermodynamic entropy, in particular, in connection with the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, we describe the quantum analog of the Boltzmann entropy, and we argue that the individualist (Boltzmannian) concept of equilibrium is supported by the recent works on thermalization of closed quantum systems. }

	abstract = {It is argued that a typical many-body energy eigenstate has a well-defined thermodynamic entropy and that individual eigenstates possess thermodynamic characteristics analogous to those of generic isolated systems. We examine large systems with eigenstate energies equivalent to finite temperatures. When quasi-static evolution of a system is adiabatic (in the quantum mechanical sense), two coupled subsystems can transfer heat from one subsystem to another and yet remain in an energy eigenstate. To explicitly construct the entropy from the wave function, degrees of freedom are divided into two unequal parts. It is argued that the entanglement entropy between these two subsystems is the thermodynamic entropy per degree of freedom for the smaller subsystem. This is done by tracing over the larger subsystem to obtain a density matrix and calculating the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to the entanglement entropy.}

This is a part of what came to be known as the Local Theory of Banach Spaces (this name was derived from the fact that in its first stages, this theory dealt mainly with relating the structure of infinite dimensional Banach spaces to the structure of their lattice of finite dimensional subspaces). Our purpose in this book is to introduce the reader to some of the results, problems, and mainly methods developed in the Local Theory, in the last few years. This by no means is a complete survey of this wide area. Some of the main topics we do not discuss here are mentioned in the Notes and Remarks section. Several books appeared recently or are going to appear shortly, which cover much of the material not covered in this book. Among these are Pisier's [Pis6] where factorization theorems related to Grothendieck's theorem are extensively discussed, and Tomczak-Jaegermann's [T-Jl] where operator ideals and distances between finite dimensional normed spaces are studied in detail. Another related book is Pietch's [Pie].},

	isbn = {978-0-8218-3792-4},
	abstract = {The observation of the concentration of measure phenomenon is inspired by isoperimetric inequalities. A familiar example is the way the uniform measure on the standard sphere \$S{\textasciicircum}n\$ becomes concentrated around the equator as the dimension gets large. This property may be interpreted in terms of functions on the sphere with small oscillations, an idea going back to Levy. The phenomenon also occurs in probability, as a version of the law of large numbers, due to Emil Borel. This book offers the basic techniques and examples of the concentration of measure phenomenon. The concentration of measure phenomenon was put forward in the early seventies by V. Milman in the asymptotic geometry of Banach spaces. It is of powerful interest in applications in various areas, such as geometry, functional analysis and infinite-dimensional integration, discrete mathematics and complexity theory, and probability theory. Particular emphasis is on geometric, functional, and probabilistic tools to reach and describe measure concentration in a number of settings. The book presents concentration functions and inequalities, isoperimetric and functional examples, spectrum and topological applications, product measures, entropic and transportation methods, as well as aspects of M. Talagrand's deep investigation of concentration in product spaces and its application in discrete mathematics and probability theory, supremum of Gaussian and empirical processes, spin glass, random matrices, etc. Prerequisites are a basic background in measure theory, functional analysis, and probability theory.},
