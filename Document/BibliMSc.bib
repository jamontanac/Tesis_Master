  abstract={Beyond their use as numerical tools, quantum trajectories can be ascribed a degree of reality in terms of quantum measurement theory. In fact, they arise naturally from considering continuous observation of a damped quantum system. A particularly useful form of quantum trajectories is as linear (but non-unitary) stochastic Schr√∂dinger equations. In the limit where a strong local oscillator is used in the detection, and where the system is not driven, these quantum trajectories can be solved. This gives an alternative derivation of the probability distributions for completed homodyne and heterodyne detection schemes. It also allows the previously intractable problem of real-time adaptive measurements to be treated. The results for an analytically soluble example of adaptive phase measurements are presented, and future developments discussed.}

The popularity of using quantum trajectories as a computational tool has exploded over the last decade, finally bringing this methodology to the level of practical application. This book explores this powerful tool to efficiently solve both static and time-dependent systems across a large area of quantum mechanics. Many of the pioneers who have either developed the subject from its inception or have improved on the subject contribute to this volume. They offer their insights on Lagrangian and Eulerian methods as well as various mixed quantum-classical techniques, among other topics."

abstract="The behaviour of a quantum system under continuous measurement (monitoring) of an observable may be described in different ways, but the most convenient selective description is given by the restricted path integrals (RPI) or equivalently by complex Hamiltonians. The consideration of a two-level system in the framework of this approach predicts that the continuous measurement of energy in such a system may visualize a quantum transition between the levels (occuring under resonant influence). The price for this visualization is the decrease of the transition probability. The continuous measurement of this type may be realized as a series of fuzzy observations of the system. The latter may be realized as scattering of electrons on a polarized atom.",

abstract="The stationary solution $\rho$ of a quantum master equation can be represented as an ensemble of pure states in a continuous infinity of ways. Here we suggest a definition of the the ``most natural'' ensemble. The first requirement is that the ensemble be physically realizable through monitoring the system's environment. We call this an 'unraveling' of the master equation. The second requirement is that it be the most robust of such ensembles. Robustness of an ensemble is defined in terms of the survival probability S(t) which is the average probability for one of its elements to remain unchanged after a time t. The most natural ensemble can thus be said to be the one produced by the maximally robust unraveling. An application of interest is the atom laser. We show that the nature of the maximally robust unraveling is closely related to the question of whether the output beam satisfies the conditions required to be a true laser beam.",

  abstract={The set of continuous norm-preserving stochastic Schr√∂dinger equations associated with the Lindblad master equation is introduced. This set is used to describe the localization properties of the state vector toward eigenstates of the environment operator. Particular focus is placed on determining the stochastic equation which exhibits the highest rate of localization for wide open systems. An equation having such a property is proposed in the case of a single non-Hermitian environment operator. This result is relevant to numerical simulations of quantum trajectories where localization properties are used to reduce the number of basis states needed to represent the system state, and thereby increase the speed of calculation.}

This paper shows in more detail how the diffusion leads to localization in position and phase space, and to symmetry breaking for chiral molecules. The theory of radioactive decay of absorbers and detectors is described in the state diffusion picture. The Mott and Gurney theory of latent image formation in photography is presented in its state diffusion version. It is an example of quantum detection without significant amplification.}

abstract="We consider a (small) quantum mechanical system which is operated by an external agent, who changes the Hamiltonian of the system according to a fixed scenario. In particular we assume that the agent (who may be called a demon) performs measurement followed by feedback, i.e., it makes a measurement of the system and changes the protocol according to the outcome. We extend to this setting the generalized Jarzynski relations, recently derived by Sagawa and Ueda for classical systems with feedback. One of the two relations by Sagawa and Ueda is derived here in error-free quantum processes, while the other is derived only when the measurement process involves classical errors. The first relation leads to a second law which takes into account the efficiency of the feedback.",

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that in a standard thermo-electric nanodevice the current and heat flows are not only dictated by the temperature and potential gradient, but also by the external action of a local quantum observer that controls the coherence of the device. Depending on how and where the observation takes place, the direction of heat and particle currents can be independently controlled. In fact, we show that the current and heat flow in a quantum material can go against the natural temperature and voltage gradients. Dynamical quantum observation offers new possibilities for the control of quantum transport far beyond classical thermal reservoirs. Through the concept of local projections, we illustrate how we can create and directionality control the injection of currents (electronic and heat) in nanodevices. This scheme provides novel strategies to construct quantum devices with application in thermoelectrics, spintronic injection, phononics, and sensing among others. In particular, highly efficient and selective spin injection might be achieved by local spin projection techniques.},
