	abstract = {The concept of entropy is fundamental to thermalization, yet appears at odds with basic principles in quantum mechanics. Statistical mechanics relies on the maximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium. However, an isolated many-body system initialized in a pure state will remain pure during Schr{\textbackslash}"\{o\}dinger evolution, and in this sense has static, zero entropy. The underlying role of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly antithetical to the success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of systems. Here we experimentally study the emergence of statistical mechanics in a quantum state, and observe the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in facilitating this emergence. We perform microscopy on an evolving quantum system, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while we measure that the full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure entanglement entropy and observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. Although the full state remains measurably pure, entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. In combination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we demonstrate how our measurements of a pure quantum state agree with the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and thermal ensembles in the presence of a near-volume law in the entanglement entropy.},

When quasi-static evolution of a system is adiabatic (in the quantum mechanical sense), two coupled subsystems can transfer heat from one subsystem to another and yet remain in an energy eigenstate. To explicitly construct the entropy from the wave function, degrees of freedom are divided into two unequal parts. It is argued that the entanglement entropy between these two subsystems is the thermodynamic entropy per degree of freedom for the smaller subsystem. This is done by tracing over the larger subsystem to obtain a density matrix and calculating the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to the entanglement entropy.},

Berry’s conjecture is expected to hold only if the corresponding classical system is chaotic, and essentially states that the energy eigenfunctions behave as if they were Gaussian random variables. We review the existing evidence, and show that previously neglected effects substantially strengthen the case for Berry’s conjecture. We study a rarefied hard-sphere gas as an explicit example of a many-body system which is known to be classically chaotic, and show that an energy eigenstate which obeys Berry’s conjecture predicts a Maxwell-Boltzmann, Bose-Einstein, or Fermi-Dirac distribution for the momentum of each constituent particle, depending on whether the wave functions are taken to be nonsymmetric, completely symmetric, or completely antisymmetric functions of the positions of the particles. We call this phenomenon eigenstate thermalization. We show that a generic initial state will approach thermal equilibrium at least as fast as O(ħ/Δ)t-1, where Δ is the uncertainty in the total energy of the gas. This result holds for an individual initial state; in contrast to the classical theory, no averaging over an ensemble of initial states is needed.

	abstract = {This work is dedicated to those who are genuinely interested in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Statistical mechanics is a very successful theory. The foundations on which it is based are radically different from the foundations of Newtonian mechanics. Probability and the law of large numbers are its fundamental ingredients. In this paper we will see how the statistical mechanical synthesis which incorporates mechanics (deterministic) and probability theory (indeterministic) works. The approach consists of replacing the actual system by a hypothetical ensemble of systems under same external conditions. From the most used prescription of Gibbs, we calculate the phase space averages of dynamical quantities and find that these phase averages agree very well with experiments. Clearly, actual experiments are not done on a hypothetical ensemble. They are done on the actual system in the laboratory and these experiments take a finite amount of time. Thus, it is usually argued that actual measurements are time averages and they are equal to phase averages due to ergodic hypothesis (time averages = phase space averages). The aim of the present review is to show that ergodic hypothesis is not relevant for equilibrium statistical mechanics (with Tolman and Landau). We will see that the solution for the problem is in the very peculiar nature of the macroscopic observables and with a very large number of degrees of freedom involved in macroscopic systems as first pointed out by Boltzmann and then more quantitatively by Khinchin. Similar arguments were used by Landau based upon the approximate property of "statistical independence". We analyze these ideas in detail. We present a critique of the ideas of Jaynes who says that the ergodic problem is a conceptual one and is related to the very concept of ensemble itself which is a by-product of the frequency theory of probability, and the ergodic problem becomes irrelevant when the probabilities of various microstates are interpreted with Laplace–Bernoulli Theory of Probability (Bayesian viewpoint).At the end, we critically review various quantum approaches (quantum-statistical typicality approaches) to the foundations of statistical mechanics. The literature on quantum-statistical typicality is organized under four notions (i) kinematical canonical typicality, (ii) dynamical canonical typicality, (iii) kinematical normal typicality, and (iv) dynamical normal typicality. Analogies are seen in the Khinchin's classical approach and in the modern quantum-statistical typicality approaches.},

We argue that it should be replaced by a general canonical principle, whose physical content is fundamentally different from the postulate it replaces: it refers to individual states, rather than to ensemble or time averages. Furthermore, whereas the original postulate is an unprovable assumption, the principle we propose is mathematically proven. The key element in this proof is the quantum entanglement between the system and its environment. Our approach separates the issue of finding the canonical state from finding out how close a system is to it, allowing us to go even beyond the usual boltzmannian situation.},

	abstract = {Information--be it classical or quantum--is measured by the amount of communication needed to convey it. In the classical case, if the receiver has some prior information about the messages being conveyed, less communication is needed. Here we explore the concept of prior quantum information: given an unknown quantum state distributed over two systems, we determine how much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system. This communication measures the partial information one system needs, conditioned on its prior information. We find that it is given by the conditional entropy--a quantity that was known previously, but lacked an operational meaning. In the classical case, partial information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it is negative, then sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential for future quantum communication. We introduce a protocol that we term 'quantum state merging' which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several important applications including distributed compression, noiseless coding with side information, multiple access channels and assisted entanglement distillation.},

Our purpose in this book is to introduce the reader to some of the results, problems, and mainly methods developed in the Local Theory, in the last few years. This by no means is a complete survey of this wide area. Some of the main topics we do not discuss here are mentioned in the Notes and Remarks section. Several books appeared recently or are going to appear shortly, which cover much of the material not covered in this book. Among these are Pisier's [Pis6] where factorization theorems related to Grothendieck's theorem are extensively discussed, and Tomczak-Jaegermann's [T-Jl] where operator ideals and distances between finite dimensional normed spaces are studied in detail. Another related book is Pietch's [Pie].},

	title = {The Concentration of Measure Phenomenon},
	isbn = {978-0-8218-3792-4},
	abstract = {The observation of the concentration of measure phenomenon is inspired by isoperimetric inequalities. A familiar example is the way the uniform measure on the standard sphere \$S{\textasciicircum}n\$ becomes concentrated around the equator as the dimension gets large. This property may be interpreted in terms of functions on the sphere with small oscillations, an idea going back to Levy. The phenomenon also occurs in probability, as a version of the law of large numbers, due to Emil Borel. This book offers the basic techniques and examples of the concentration of measure phenomenon. The concentration of measure phenomenon was put forward in the early seventies by V. Milman in the asymptotic geometry of Banach spaces. It is of powerful interest in applications in various areas, such as geometry, functional analysis and infinite-dimensional integration, discrete mathematics and complexity theory, and probability theory. Particular emphasis is on geometric, functional, and probabilistic tools to reach and describe measure concentration in a number of settings. The book presents concentration functions and inequalities, isoperimetric and functional examples, spectrum and topological applications, product measures, entropic and transportation methods, as well as aspects of M. Talagrand's deep investigation of concentration in product spaces and its application in discrete mathematics and probability theory, supremum of Gaussian and empirical processes, spin glass, random matrices, etc. Prerequisites are a basic background in measure theory, functional analysis, and probability theory.},

We prove, with virtually full generality, that reaching equilibrium is a universal property of quantum systems: almost any subsystem in interaction with a large enough bath will reach an equilibrium state and remain close to it for almost all times. We also prove several general results about other aspects of thermalization besides equilibration, for example, that the equilibrium state does not depend on the detailed microstate of the bath.},

In contrast, the Boltzmann entropy is a function on phase space, and is thus defined for an individual system. Our aim is to discuss and compare these two notions of entropy, along with the associated ensemblist and individualist views of thermal equilibrium. Using the Gibbsian ensembles for the computation of the Gibbs entropy, the two notions yield the same (leading order) values for the entropy of a macroscopic system in thermal equilibrium. The two approaches do not, however, necessarily agree for non-equilibrium systems. For those, we argue that the Boltzmann entropy is the one that corresponds to thermodynamic entropy, in particular in connection with the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, we describe the quantum analog of the Boltzmann entropy, and we argue that the individualist (Boltzmannian) concept of equilibrium is supported by the recent works on thermalization of closed quantum systems.},

These topics lie at the heart of many exciting areas of contemporary science and engineering - communication, signal processing, data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, computational neuroscience, bioinformatics, and cryptography. This textbook introduces theory in tandem with applications. Information theory is taught alongside practical communication systems, such as arithmetic coding for data compression and sparse-graph codes for error-correction. A toolbox of inference techniques, including message-passing algorithms, Monte Carlo methods, and variational approximations, are developed alongside applications of these tools to clustering, convolutional codes, independent component analysis, and neural networks. The final part of the book describes the state of the art in error-correcting codes, including low-density parity-check codes, turbo codes, and digital fountain codes -- the twenty-first century standards for satellite communications, disk drives, and data broadcast. Richly illustrated, filled with worked examples and over 400 exercises, some with detailed solutions, David {MacKay}'s groundbreaking book is ideal for self-learning and for undergraduate or graduate courses. Interludes on crosswords, evolution, and sex provide entertainment along the way.

This is done from the point of view of the cryptographer with a particular eye on applications in quantum cryptography. Each of the measures considered is rooted in an analogous classical measure of distinguishability for probability distributions: namely, the probability of an identification error, the Kolmogorov distance, the Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the Shannon (1948) distinguishability (as defined through mutual information). These measures have a long history of use in statistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several inequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other, one of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic key distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting inequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential indistinguishability for two families of quantum states. This is a tool that may prove useful in the analysis of various quantum-cryptographic protocols.},

	abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of interest in using R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropies as quantifiers of correlations in many-body quantum systems. However, it is well known that in general these entropies do not satisfy the strong subadditivity inequality, which is a central property ensuring the positivity of correlation measures. In fact, in many cases they do not even satisfy the weaker condition of subadditivity. In the present paper we shed light on this subject by providing a detailed survey of R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropies for bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states. We show that for bosons the R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropies always satisfy subadditivity, but not necessarily strong subadditivity. Conversely, for fermions both do not hold in general. We provide the precise intervals of the R{\textbackslash}'enyi index \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ for which subadditivity and strong subadditivity are valid in each case.},

We first discuss in some details the simplest "toy model" in which Majoranas appear, namely a one-dimensional tight-binding representation of a p-wave superconductor, introduced more than ten years ago by Kitaev. We then give a general introduction to the remarkable properties of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems, such as their intrinsically non-local nature and exotic exchange statistics, and explain why these quasiparticles are suspected to be especially well suited for low-decoherence quantum information processing. We also discuss the experimentally promising (and perhaps already successfully realized) possibility of creating topological superconductors using semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, proximity-coupled to standard s-wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field. The goal is to provide an introduction to the subject for experimentalists or theorists who are new to the field, focusing on the aspects which are most important for understanding the basic physics. The text should be accessible for readers with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and second quantization, and does not require knowledge of quantum field theory or topological states of matter.},

The bound is constructed by upper-bounding the average error probability over an ensemble of codes. The bound is known to give the correct exponential dependence of error probability on block length for transmission rates above the critical rate, but it gives an incorrect exponential dependence at rates below a second lower critical rate. Here we derive an asymptotic expression for the average error probability over the ensemble of codes used in the random coding bound. The result shows that the weakness of the random coding bound at rates below the second critical rate is due not to upperbounding the ensemble average, but rather to the fact that the best codes are much better than the average at low rates.},

A general formalism for calculating the instantaneous correlation between any two spins is developed and applied to the investigation of short- and long-range order. Both models show nonvanishing long-range order in the ground state for a range of values of a certain parameter λ which is analogous to an anisotropy parameter in the Heisenberg model. A detailed comparison with the Heisenberg model suggests that the latter has no long-range order in the isotropic case but finite long-range order for any finite amount of anisotropy. The unreliability of variational methods for determining long-range order is emphasized. It is also shown that for spin 12 systems having rather general isotropic Heisenberg interactions favoring an antiferromagnetic ordering, the ground state is nondegenerate and there is no energy gap above the ground state in the energy spectrum of the total system.},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional Ising model in a transverse field can be mapped onto a system of spinless fermions with p-wave superconductivity. In the weak-coupling {BCS} regime, it exhibits a zero energy Majorana mode at each end of the chain. Here, we consider a variation of the model, which represents a superconductor with longer ranged kinetic energy and pairing amplitudes, as is likely to occur in more realistic systems. It possesses a richer zero temperature phase diagram and has several quantum phase transitions. From an exact solution of the model these phases can be classified according to the number of Majorana zero modes of an open chain: 0, 1, or 2 at each end. The model posseses a multicritical point where phases with 0, 1, and 2 Majorana end modes meet. The number of Majorana modes at each end of the chain is identical to the topological winding number of the Anderson's pseudospin vector that describes the {BCS} Hamiltonian. The topological classification of the phases requires a unitary time-reversal symmetry to be present. When this symmetry is broken, only the number of Majorana end modes modulo 2 can be used to distinguish two phases. In one of the regimes, the wave functions of the two phase shifted Majorana zero modes decays exponentially in space but but in an oscillatory manner. The wavelength of oscillation is identical to the asymptotic connected spin-spin correlation of the {XY}-model in a transverse field to which our model is dual.},

We describe the general method in Section 10.1, whose theoretical properties are less complete than for the two-stage special case (see Section 10.2): The defining difference between that sampler and the multi-stage version considered here is that the interleaving structure of the two-stage chain does not carry over. Some of the consequences of interleaving are the fact that the individual subchains are also Markov chains, and the Duality Principle and Rao-Blackwellization hold in some generality. None of that is true here, in the multi-stage case. Nevertheless, the multi-stage Gibbs sampler enjoys many optimality properties, and still might be considered the workhorse of the {MCMC} world. The remainder of this chapter deals with implementation considerations, many in connection with the important role of the Gibbs sampler in Bayesian Statistics.},

	abstract = {In a family study of breast cancer, epidemiologists in Southern California increase the power for detecting a gene-environment interaction. In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation.Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces {MCMC} methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of {MCMC} methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying {MCMC} in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing {MCMC}, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains.Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential. It shows the importance of {MCMC} in real applications, such as archaeology, astronomy, biostatistics, genetics, epidemiology, and image analysis, and provides an excellent base for {MCMC} to be applied to other fields as well.},

abstract = "Computational anatomy is the science of anatomical shape examined by deforming a template organ into a subject organ. It compares and contrasts organ shapes to inspire personalized treatments or find group differences in case-control studies. Independently of the transformation model used, the task of finding deformations between organs is a statistical task concerned with estimating parameters. Recently it has become important to go beyond “best” estimates and quantify the variability of estimates. The variability is caused by noise in the image, model misspecification, or sampling variability in an observational study. Bayesian statistics provides a rigorous framework to build models that can quantify uncertainty. In this book chapter, we will review some of the basics of Bayesian statistics and relate it to our own experience in applying Bayesian ideas in computational anatomy. We will divide the presentation into two parts. First, we formulate image registration using parametric Bayesian statistics and elaborate on some of the practical difficulties that we encountered in our own work. Second, we will give an example of nonparametric Bayesian statistics applied to clustering of deformation fields into parcels of contiguous voxels."
