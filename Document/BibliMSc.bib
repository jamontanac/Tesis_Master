	abstract = {We study multi-qubit quantum channels that can be represented as a product of one-mode fermionic attenuation channels. An explicit formula for the classical capacity \$C\_1\$ and for the minimum output entropy \$S\_\{min\}\$ of these channels is proposed. We compute \$S\_\{min\}\$ analytically for any number of qubits under assumption that the minimum is achieved on a Gaussian input. Apart from that, a simple numerical method for evaluating \$S\_\{min\}\$ is developed. The method is applicable to any channels that are sufficiently noisy. For fermionic product channels the proposed formula for \$S\_\{min\}\$ agrees with the numerical results with a precision about \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-9\}\$.},

	abstract = {This short review article provides a pedagogical introduction to the rapidly growing research field of Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We first discuss in some details the simplest "toy model" in which Majoranas appear, namely a one-dimensional tight-binding representation of a p-wave superconductor, introduced more than ten years ago by Kitaev. We then give a general introduction to the remarkable properties of Majorana fermions in condensed matter systems, such as their intrinsically non-local nature and exotic exchange statistics, and explain why these quasiparticles are suspected to be especially well suited for low-decoherence quantum information processing. We also discuss the experimentally promising (and perhaps already successfully realized) possibility of creating topological superconductors using semiconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling, proximity-coupled to standard s-wave superconductors and exposed to a magnetic field. The goal is to provide an introduction to the subject for experimentalists or theorists who are new to the field, focusing on the aspects which are most important for understanding the basic physics. The text should be accessible for readers with a basic understanding of quantum mechanics and second quantization, and does not require knowledge of quantum field theory or topological states of matter.},

Implications of such a result to Hilbert space truncation for real-space renormalization schemes is discussed.},

While the concept is widely used and its physical meaning is clear there exists no systematic and mathematical theory of pairing which would allow to unambiguously characterize and systematically detect paired states. We propose a definition of pairing and develop methods for its detection and quantification applicable to current experimental setups. Pairing is shown to be a quantum correlation different from entanglement, giving further understanding in the structure of highly correlated quantum systems. In addition, we will show the resource character of paired states for precision metrology, proving that the {BCS} states allow phase measurements at the Heisenberg limit.},
